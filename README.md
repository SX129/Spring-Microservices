This project is a microservices-based application built using Java and Spring Boot. It consists of three independent microservices: Company, Job, and Review. Each service has its own database and runs on its own server. The system is containerized using Docker, and various Spring Cloud components are used to facilitate inter-service communication, configuration management, and monitoring.
